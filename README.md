# WeatherGuesser
This is a project I started for learning machine learning better.

WeatherGuesser is a software that guesses the temperature for a city given the last three days temperature of that city and the last day temperature of three neighbouring cities.
The code learns from the past temperature data of that city and the neighbours

There is also a part that guesses the weather type (sunny, cloudy, foggy, snowy, rainy) based on the older data.
To do this kNN algorithm is applied.
